    My research interests are in the field of astroparticle physics and primarily include
    indirect dark-matter searches using high-energy data from various astrophysical sources.
    I am currently studying axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with NASA's <i> Fermi </i> Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
    under the guidance of Dr. Regina Caputo <i>(NASA Goddard)</i> and Dr. Manuel Meyer <i>(Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg)</i>.<br></br>
    I am also involved in various multimessenger efforts; in particular, I am a member of a group led by Dr. Michela Negro <i>(NASA Goddard)</i> working
    on cross-correlation studies between IceCube astrophysical neutrino maps and the <i> Fermi</i>-LAT gamma-ray sky.
    Finally, I also work on <i> Swift</i>-BAT GRB sub-threshold analysis of LIGO/Virgo graviatational-wave triggers.

  <h2 class="post-page-title">Dark-matter hunting</h2>


  <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
   ALP, a generalized case of the QCD axion, belongs to the family of weakly interacting sub-eV particles (WISPs).
   This particle is a well-motivated candidate for constituting a significant fraction of cold dark
   matter in the Universe. ALPs are hypothesized to be produced via misalignment mechanism soon after the Big Bang. A small
   fraction of ALPs could still be produced in high-energy environments, such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe),
   and converted into gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic field via inverse Primakoff process, spectrally peaking in the
   MeV energy range.

<figcaption style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:12px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">Fig.1 - <i> Thermal photons produced in a core-collapse are converted into ALPs via Primakoff proccess
  in the presence of a local magnetic field. They travel undisturbed until they reach the Galactic magnetic field, where they undergo
  the inverse Primakoff process. Photons produced in this conversion may be observed by gamma-ray observatories, for example Fermi. </i> </font>

<br></br>
<p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
  As CCSNe are often described as progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs); analyzing the gamma-ray spectra of LGRBs
  as seen by <i> Fermi </i> LAT can provide us with insights and further constraints of the ALP parameter space. Furthermore,
  instrument sensitivity testing, as well as trigger-time analysis, are valuable pieces of information when it comes to searching for
  ALP spectral signatures. Stay tuned for a paper (currently in prep.) that will summarize my findings related to <i> Fermi</i>-detected LGRBs
  in the context of ALP searches.

  <h2 class="post-page-title">Past Research</h2>
  <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
    My research interests during the undergraduate
    years were two-fold: I studied physics on very small scales, specifically
    the attraction forces between two plates due to quantum fluctuations
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect">Casimir effect</a>);
     and physics on large scales, by studying the co-evolution of galaxies
    and supermassive black holes at their centers. Coming to graduate school,
    I decided to further explore these two interests and combine them through my current
    research in dark matter.</p>


<h4 class="post-page-title">Probing quasar/galaxy co-evolution</h4>
    <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">

    The summer of my sophomore year as an undergraduate, I was part of a four-member research group that worked
    under Professor Eilat Glikman’s guidance on evaluating and utilizing new selection criteria for dust-reddened
    quasars. We considered sources with high luminosities in the near-infrared region (K&lt15.1, 2 μm)
    in an equatorial stripe of sky (SDSS Stripe 82) that had been missed by the SDSS’s selection algorithm.
    We characterized objects using BPT diagrams which separate out the nature of the photoionizing source. As a result,
    our sample of low-redshift, luminous, and obscured quasars provide an excellent set for follow-up observations with high-resolution
    instruments, with the goal of offering evidence of mergers and probing into early evolutionary phases of a galaxy.
    The results of this work have been published <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...861...37G/abstract">here</a>.
    <br></br>
    As a part of my undergraduate senior thesis, I conducted research in post-merger galaxy dynamics.
    I analyzed data from the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph (Keck) combined with Laser Guide-Star
    Adaptive Optics (LGS) to better understand the evolution of moderately dust-reddened quasars as
    well as their hosting galaxies. If you would like a copy of my undergraduate thesis or have questions
    regarding the IFS spectral analysis, please do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.




<h4 class="post-page-title">Casimir effect</h4>
<p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
Under the guidance of Professor Noah Graham, I carried out research concerning the edge
expansion for scalar Casimir energies. Presented with electromagnetic results for a configuration
consisting of an oblate spheroid facing a perfectly conducting plane, I proposed a less computationally
expensive analysis of the Casimir force using a scalar field theory. This approach required modifications
and improvements of the existing code written in C that
computes spheroidal functions. I presented this project at the Middlebury Summer Symposium in 2016, please feel free to reach out for more detail.
