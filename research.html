    My research interests are in the field of astroparticle physics and primarily include
    indirect dark-matter searches using high-energy data from various astrophysical sources.
    I am currently studying axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with NASA's <i> Fermi </i> Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
    under the guidance of Dr. Regina Caputo <i>(NASA Goddard)</i> and Dr. Manuel Meyer <i>(University of Hamburg)</i>.<br></br>
    I am also involved in various multimessenger efforts; in particular, I am a member of a group led by Dr. Michela Negro <i>(NASA Goddard)</i> working
    on cross-correlation studies between IceCube astrophysical neutrino maps and the <i> Fermi</i>-LAT gamma-ray sky.
    Finally, I also work on <i> Swift</i>-BAT GRB sub-threshold analysis of LIGO/Virgo graviatational-wave triggers.

  <h2 class="post-page-title">Dark-matter hunting</h2>


  <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
   ALP, a generalized case of the QCD axion, belongs to the family of weakly interacting sub-eV particles (WISPs).
   This particle is a well-motivated candidate for constituting a significant fraction of cold dark
   matter in the Universe. ALPs are hypothesized to be produced via misalignment mechanism soon after the Big Bang. A small
   fraction of ALPs could still be produced in high-energy environments, such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe),
   and converted into gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic field via inverse Primakoff process, spectrally peaking in the
   MeV energy range.

<figcaption style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:12px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px"><i> Thermal photons produced in a core-collapse are converted into ALPs via Primakoff proccess in the electrostatic fields of protons and ions. They travel undisturbed until they reach the Galactic magnetic field, where they undergo
  the inverse Primakoff process. Photons produced in this conversion may be observed by gamma-ray observatories, for example Fermi. </i> </font>

<p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
  As CCSNe are often described as progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs); analyzing the gamma-ray spectra of LGRBs
  as seen by <i> Fermi </i> LAT can provide us with insights and further constraints of the ALP parameter space. Furthermore,
  instrument sensitivity testing, as well as trigger-time analysis, are valuable pieces of information when it comes to searching for
  ALP spectral signatures.
<br></br>
  Studying the sensitivity of <i> Fermi </i> LAT and, in particular, applying the LAT's Low-energy (LLE) technique is one of the main
  goals of our work in <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.103001">Crnogorčević et al. 2021</a> (publicly available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05790">arXiv</a>).
  Here, we conduct a data-driven sensitivity analysis to find the distance limit for a hypothetical ALP detection with the LLE technique which, in contrast to the standard LAT analysis, allows for a a larger effective area for energies down to 30 MeV.
  We also select a candidate sample of twenty-four GRBs and carry out a model comparison analysis in which we consider different GRB spectral models with and without an ALP signal component.
  In this paper, you can learn about the statistical methods used in our analysis (Wilks' theorem to the rescue!) and the underlying physical assumptions,
  the feasibility of the upper limits on ALP coupling from our model comparison results,
  and an outlook on future MeV instruments in the context of ALP searches.
</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="img/10M_distance_coupling_10sec.png" style="padding: 40px; float: left; max-width:55%;" title="LLE ALP Distance-coupling parametar space!"/></p>
  </figure>
  <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
  To the left, we have a plot that shows distance limits for a hypothetical ALP detection using the LLE technique,
  for a 10-solar-mass progenitor. The green, black, and solid red lines represent the 5-sigma detection limits on distances
  with so-far observed background levels from our GRB sample, while the yellow solid line represents the expected 90%
  confidence level upper limit for the median background. The dotted vertical line in the plot shows the upper limit for the
  ALP-photon coupling derived from literature. Finally, the gray hatching shows the parameter space to which LLE
  is sensitive. So, for example, for the low background (green line) the upper distance limit is ~4.4 Mpc; for the median background it is ~4.9 Mpc,
  and for the highest bacground we can reach ~6.6 Mpc.
<br></br>
  In my opinion, this is an interesting result---and somewhat counterintuitive! It seems that if we have higher background levels (i.e. more noise in our data),
  we can detect ALPs that originate from sources further away, and when we have less background (i.e. "cleaner" data) we do not seem to reach quite as far. Why do you think that's the case?

<h4 class="post-page-title">Probing quasar/galaxy co-evolution</h4>
    <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">

    The summer of my sophomore year as an undergraduate, I was part of a four-member research group that worked
    under Professor Eilat Glikman’s guidance on evaluating and utilizing new selection criteria for dust-reddened
    quasars. We considered sources with high luminosities in the near-infrared region (K&lt15.1, 2 μm)
    in an equatorial stripe of sky (SDSS Stripe 82) that had been missed by the SDSS’s selection algorithm.
    We characterized objects using BPT diagrams which separate out the nature of the photoionizing source. As a result,
    our sample of low-redshift, luminous, and obscured quasars provide an excellent set for follow-up observations with high-resolution
    instruments, with the goal of offering evidence of mergers and probing into early evolutionary phases of a galaxy.
    The results of this work have been published <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...861...37G/abstract">here</a>.
    <br></br>
    As a part of my undergraduate senior thesis, I conducted research in post-merger galaxy dynamics.
    I analyzed data from the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph (Keck) combined with Laser Guide-Star
    Adaptive Optics (LGS) to better understand the evolution of moderately dust-reddened quasars as
    well as their hosting galaxies. If you would like a copy of my undergraduate thesis or have questions
    regarding the IFS spectral analysis, please do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.




<h4 class="post-page-title">Casimir effect</h4>
<p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
Under the guidance of Professor Noah Graham, I carried out research concerning the edge
expansion for scalar Casimir energies. Presented with electromagnetic results for a configuration
consisting of an oblate spheroid facing a perfectly conducting plane, I proposed a less computationally
expensive analysis of the Casimir force using a scalar field theory. This approach required modifications
and improvements of the existing code written in C that
computes spheroidal functions. I presented this project at the Middlebury Summer Symposium in 2016, please feel free to reach out for more detail.
</p>

<h9 class="post-page-title "><span style="color: #2471A3; font-size:16px"><i>(bonus) How did I choose my research...and why?</i></span></h9>
<p style = "font-family: monospace;font-size:15px; LINE-HEIGHT:20px">
  The decision to attend a liberal arts institution (Middlebury College) followed from my desire to obtain a well-rounded
  education that allows for a direct exposure to and learning from critical thinkers within different
  academic disciplines, making me a more inquisitive and creative scientist. My research interests during the undergraduate
  years were two-fold: I studied physics on very small scales, specifically
  the attraction forces between two plates due to quantum fluctuations
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect">Casimir effect</a>);
   and physics on large scales, by studying the co-evolution of galaxies
  and supermassive black holes at their centers. Coming to graduate school,
  I decided to further explore these two interests and combine them through my current
  research in dark matter and high-energy astroparticle physics. My primary graduate school goal is similar to my
  undergraduate one: I want to be a well-rounded astrophysicist, continuously enhancing my literacy in a wide range of topics. As such,
  while I am developing a strong expertise in the field of astrophysical searches for ALPs, I am also
  intentional in exposing myself to different analysis methods and topics (e.g. multimessenger analysis with neutrinos and
  gravitational waves, stellar evolution, magnetic-field modeling, subthreshold searches, instrumentation, etc.) I also thoroughly enjoy
  being in classes--both as a student and an instructor--and love learning about the Universe from different perspectives and at different scales
  (my dream job would be taking classes for the rest of my life. And, some exposure time to an unknown topic, the chances are I'll get interested!)
