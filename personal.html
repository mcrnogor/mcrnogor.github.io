  <i> Before the age of sixteen, I changed three home countries without changing my residential address.
      Then I moved to another country. At eighteen years old, I moved again. At twenty-two, again.</i>
      <br><br>

      I was born and raised in a small town on the coast of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1994–2002),
      or Serbia and Montenegro (2002–2006), or Montenegro (2006–2011). In 2011, I hopped on a plane by
      myself and left my home country to attend Li Po Chun United World College in Hong Kong,
      a high school with two hundred students from more than ninety countries, on a full merit-based scholarship.
      In September of 2013, I moved to Vermont, USA, as a Davis UWC Scholar to study at Middlebury College where
      I obtained my undergraduate degree. Finally, in 2017, I moved to Maryland, where I have lived ever since.
      Being a member of different communities constantly reshaped my personality by putting various skills and parts
      of my identity forward and, in turn, strongly influenced my development as a scientist.

<br><br>
      Nowadays, I am most likely to be found in my office in ATL 1259, but ever so often I tunnel out to enjoy a good play,
      concert, cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, or a volleyball game (I play on the Astronomy Department IM team Dirty Snowballs!)
      I grew up on the Adriatic coast (Herceg-Novi, Montenegro), which probably explains my love for water sports: I am an avid
      swimmer and love everything sea-related. You can find me at the pool multiple times a week, swimming with the Terrapin Masters Team (our relay made <a href=https://www.usms.org/comp/tt/toptenrelaylist.php?Year=2019&CourseID=3&AgeGroupID=11&Sex=W&SwimmerID=02TVT> the 2nd best time in the US </a> for our age group in 2019!)
      Other interests include reading, creative writing, spoken word, (programming and human) languages and linguistics,
      <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx">math puzzles</a>, NYT crossword puzzles, and drawing.

Below is a selection of photographs depicting ± who I am and how I got there, in no particular order.
